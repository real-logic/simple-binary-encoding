Overview
========

There is a [user guide](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Csharp-User-Guide) for people who wish
to use the C# generator.  This document is to assist developers working on the the SBE C# generator itself.


Environment
-----------
Java and gradlew are used to build the generator.

git bash and shell scripts are used for scripting.

The C# code is built using Visual Studio Community 2017.

Code Layout
-----------
The Java code that performs the generation of C# code is
[here](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/tree/master/sbe-tool/src/main/java/uk/co/real_logic/sbe/generation/csharp).

    $ ./gradlew                       # Will build sbe-tool jar
    $ ./gradlew generateCSharpCodecs  # will generate the test, benchmark, and example C# code

The [Visual Studio 2017 Community
solution](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/csharp/csharp.sln) provides the projects:

 * sbe-dll (for common marshalling and DirectBuffer functionality)
 * sbe-generated (containing C# code generated by sbe-tool)
 * sbe-tests (an mstest suite for unit testing)
 * sbe-benchmarks (for performance testing and tuning)
 * sbe-example-car (sample code based on the Car example)
 * sbe-example-extension (sample code based on the Car extension)
 
Roadmap
-------
The csharp generator is as of March 2018 a beta release. The current roadmap contains: 

 * Improved Documentation
 * Testing/bug fixes
 * Better nuget Packaging 
 * Possible changes to make group objects accessible without requiring
   a linear progression.

Nuget Package
-------------
The nuget package can be built using ~csharp/.nuget/do-release.sh. It has a dependency on the [nuget.exe]
(https://dist.nuget.org/index.html).

Before release it will probbalty be necessary to copy in changed files for the example contained in the published nuget
package. This is a manual process for now.

Once the nuget package is built it can be tested within the example project by adding a local disk path to the nuget
file locations and then updating sbe-tool within the example. 


Want to build things yourself?
------------------------------

For now you can:

 * build the SBE csharp generator using `gradlew`
 * generate the csharp codecs using `gradlew GenerateCSharpCodecs`
 * Use the [Visual Studio 2017 Community solution](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/csharp/csharp.sln) to build the solution, run the unit tests, examples and benchmarks
 * Use the command script
 * [csharpbuild.cmd](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/csharp/csharpbuild.cmd) to build the dotnet core support
 * Use the bash script [runtests.sh](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/csharp/runtests.sh) to run the tests
 * Build the nuget package via [do-release.sh](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/csharp/.nuget/do-release.sh) although this remains a largely manual process.
